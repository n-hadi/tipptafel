useless garbage P2P betting site that nobody ever used, which I made a few years ago with Django and HTMX.  
UI looks like utter shit code is ugly too, but it works more or less.
payments are done with bitcoin and a seperate btcpayserver i set up. 

concept:
a football game has 3 outcomes team1 wins, team2 wins, or draw. users can create a bet and pick 1 or 2 out of the three outcomes and set a stake. 
if a game cannot have a draw then of course theres only one option to pick out of 2: either team1 wins or team2 wins.
lets say i create a bet and bet chelsea wins against mancity or they play draw and i bet 20 taler (inhouse site currency). now you wait for another user to accept the bet.
both users stake 20 taler. so if chelsea wins or they draw i get my 20 taler back and the 20 taler from the opponent. 
if mancity wins the other nigga gets my 20 taler and his 20 talers.
